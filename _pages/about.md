I am currently a research engineer at the [Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy](https://citp.princeton.edu/), where I work with Arvind Narayanan and Zeynep Tufekci on multiple projects relating to AI agent evaluation and the societal impacts of AI. I am a recent MPA graduate from Princeton, where I also completed a graduate certificate in statistics and machine learning. My main research interests are in artificial intelligence, moral philosophy, intergenerational mobility, and social safety net implementation. I have also worked in civic technology, most recently at the US Census Bureau as a [Coding it Forward Data Science Fellow](https://www.codingitforward.com/), and prior to that, as a data analyst with the [Massachusetts Digital Service](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-digital-service). I received my BA from Williams College in 2020, where I studied political economy, philosophy, and cognitive science. Outside of work, I am an avid runner and cyclist and love spending long days in the mountains.

This spring, I wrote a [paper](https://peterkirgis.github.io/files/MFT_LLMs.pdf) analyzing the ethical judgements of 21 frontier language models using Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations theory, which I presented at Princeton's 2025 PICSciE/CSML Joint Colloquium. You can read a profile of that project [here](https://csml.princeton.edu/news/peter-kirgis-exploring-moral-foundations-large-language-models).
