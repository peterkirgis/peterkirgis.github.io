I am currently a second year MPA student at Princeton University, where I am also completing a graduate certificate in statistics and machine learning. My main research interests are in artificial intelligence, moral philosophy, intergenerational mobility, and social safety net implementation. I have also worked in civic technology, most recently at the US Census Bureau as a [Coding it Forward Data Science Fellow](https://www.codingitforward.com/), and prior to that, as a data analyst with the [Massachusetts Digital Service](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-digital-service). I received my BA from Williams College in 2020, where I studied political economy, philosophy, and cognitive science. Outside of work, I am an avid runner and cyclist and love spending long days in the mountains.

Right now, I am most interested in AI alignment research and policy. I am currently working on a project to use machine learning to analyze the moral reasoning of frontier large language models.
